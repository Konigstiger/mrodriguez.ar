# [mrodriguez.ar][1]
This is my personal website, with my job experience, and links to my UI/UX Portfolio, CV, and maybe more things.

## Characteristics
Made with:
- [React][3]
- [Node.js][4]
- [TypeScript][5]
- [MUI Library][6] (Material UI, components)
- [Tailwind CSS][7] (Styles)
- Love
- Suffering

## usage
You can use this personal website, clone, fork it, download it, and *adapt it to your needs*. There's a lot of room for improvement and customization. Please don't use this template for something illegal. Actually, don't do anything illegal. Instead, why not try to adapt this to yourself? You can create something beautiful with the technology that is under-used here. I only scratched the surface.

## copyright and legal stuff
As I said, feel free to do whatever legal and moral thing you like with my code.

### Found a bug? Want to be a friend?
If you see one bug, have an assertive suggestion, or want to ask me something, you can contact me at querys@mrodriguez.ar. I will try to answer as soon as possible. Also, you could try my [blog][2].

## About me
I'm a Senior *Software Developer* experienced in several programming languages and industries.
I have a passion for **UI/UX Design** as a complement to Full Stack Development. 
I like to create neat, organized code, working in an agile fashion.
I like to involve the client and the end users in the design process and validate their needs and accessibility aspects, among other *quality* factors, like extensibility and security. I think that developing software, be it as UI/UX, Designer, or Coder is not about making diagrams and code: itÂ´s about solving the client and the user's needs as well.

## About you
Remember, it's about solving the client needs. A happy client is a happy payday, someday!

## Are you a recruiter? Do you want my CV for your collection?
If so, hello and welcome! You can contact me through my LinkedIn, or email me at work@mrodriguez.ar.
Thank you for your interest.
